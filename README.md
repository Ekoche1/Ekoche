<h1>Hi, I'm Victor Ekoche Ali <br/>
📊 Research & Data Analyst | ✍🏽 Academic Writer


<h2> 🧠 Who I Am</h2>

I'm a data & research enthusiast passionate about turning complex thoughts and messy datasets into structured, impactful outputs. From research papers to community-driven reports, I bring clarity through data analysis, literature reviews, and evidence-based writing.

Currently learning the ropes of Power BI, Python, SQL, and dashboarding — and documenting everything I learn.
